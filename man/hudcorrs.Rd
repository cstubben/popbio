\title{ Correlation matrices for Hudsonia vital rates}
\description{
  Within year and between year correlation matrices from
  \emph{Hudsonia montana} vital rates.  Correlations were calculated
  from first 13 growth and survival rates only, since
  fertility rates vary little. 
}
\usage{data(hudcorrs)}
\format{
  A list with 2 correlation matrices, corrin (within year correlation)
  and corrout (between year correlation).

\source{ The correlation matrices in Morris and Doak 2002 include some
correlations > 1.  A corrected set of correlations was sent by the
