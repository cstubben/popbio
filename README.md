# popbio

`popbio` is an `R` package for modeling population growth rates using age- or stage-classified matrix models.  The package consists mainly of methods described in Hal Caswell's Matrix Population Models (2001) and Morris and Doak's Quantitative Conservation Biology (2002).  The `R` code was first submitted to CRAN in 2007.
